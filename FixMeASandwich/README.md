# Project Title

This project is a POS (point of sales) application for a custom sandwich shop. 
The project's purpose is to modernize the sandwich shop's ordering system to an online platform. <br>
The resulting POS takes advantage of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design 
by utilizing OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts to build classes and interfaces.

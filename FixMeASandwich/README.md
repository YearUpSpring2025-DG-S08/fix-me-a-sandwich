# Sandwich Shop POS System

A modern point-of-sale application that digitizes the sandwich ordering process, built with Java and object-oriented design principles.

## Overview

This project transforms traditional sandwich shop operations by replacing paper orders and manual processes with an intuitive digital ordering system. Customers can build custom sandwiches while the system handles pricing, order management, and workflow automation.

## Features

- **Custom Sandwich Builder**: Interactive interface for selecting bread, meats, cheeses, and toppings
- **Automated Pricing**: Real-time price calculations based on selections
- **Order Management**: Complete workflow from order creation to completion
- **Inventory Tracking**: Monitor ingredient availability and usage

## Technical Highlights

Built using object-oriented programming principles with modular, reusable components:
- Clean separation of concerns through class-based architecture
- Extensible design for easy feature additions
- Maintainable codebase with clear interfaces and abstractions

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Design
- Console-based user interface

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd sandwich-shop-pos

# Compile and run
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Project Goals

This application demonstrates practical software development skills by solving real business challenges through thoughtful design. 
The modular architecture makes it easy to extend functionality, such as adding new sandwich types, payment methods, or reporting features.
